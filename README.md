# TSF-Internship
The following tasks were performed during my tenure as an intern at The Sparks Foundation.

## Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML
In this task, we predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they have studied. The task is a Simple Linear Regression task as it involves just two variables. The question "What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs in a day?" will be answered after completing the task.
